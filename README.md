# Proof of Concept for Pixel 
This document proposes a novel application of pixel art program which allows users to create pixel art, and provides tools to make it easier to do so. This application will have features such as layers and fill tool. It will also have a clean interface so it is intuitive to use.

# How to Build
Prerequisites:
- Currently there is only a build script for only linux, but a build script can be made for windows as well.
- SDL2 will be used for this
- It does not matter what IDE is used

Edit the follwing instructions:
- clone the code from the main branch
- navigate to the file in terminal
- run the build.sh script to compile the source code

# How to Run and Test
- once the build.sh script finishes running, navigate to the build folder in the same directory
- from there you are able to run ./pixel, which will open a empty window with the title of Pixel
